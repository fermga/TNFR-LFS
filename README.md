# TNFR × LFS Toolkit

TNFR × LFS brings the **Fractal-Resonant Nature Theory** into the **Live for
Speed** simulator so race engineers can capture telemetry, analyse driver
sessions, and surface setup recommendations without leaving the paddock.

## Key features

- Live ΔNFR HUD and capture pipeline wired directly to Live for Speed
  OutSim/OutGauge streams.
- Automated baselines, analysis, suggestions, and reporting from a single CLI.
- Extensible exporters (JSONL, Markdown, HTML) and configuration packs for
  repeatable engineering workflows.
- Benchmark suite and reproducible examples for regression testing new ideas.

## Getting started

For the complete onboarding walkthrough—including environment preparation,
telemetry configuration, and the first capture run—head to the
[beginner quickstart](docs/tutorials.md#1-install-the-toolkit). A condensed
summary of the workflow also lives in the
[documentation index](docs/index.md#quickstart-overview) so you can jump back
to the relevant step without duplicating content in the README.

## Learn more

The [documentation index](docs/index.md) hosts the complete manual and should
be considered the source of truth for installation details, telemetry
references, CLI walkthroughs, API docs, and advanced workflow guides.
